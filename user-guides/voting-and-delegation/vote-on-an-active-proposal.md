# ðŸ—³ Vote on an Active Proposal

Before getting started, ensure that you have connected your wallet.

{% content-ref url="connect-your-wallet.md" %}
[connect-your-wallet.md](connect-your-wallet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Also confirm that you have voting power delegated to your address.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. **You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="delegate-votes.md" %}
[delegate-votes.md](delegate-votes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## How to Vote:

Select the active proposal that you'd like to vote on. You can access this from the front page by selecting the governance system, and then scrolling down below the delegate voting power chart.
