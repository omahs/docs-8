# Disconnect Your Wallet

If you wish to disconnect your wallet from Tally, or switch to an alternate wallet address, you can do this through your selected wallet provider. The steps below show the process for disconnecting a Metamask wallet.

Open the extension in your browser, then select the "connected" link in the upper left.&#x20;

You can confirm your wallet has been disconnected by checking the top right corner of the Tally App, which should now show the option to "connect wallet".
