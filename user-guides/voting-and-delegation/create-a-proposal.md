# ✍ Create a Proposal

To submit a proposal, you must have at least enough voting power to meet the DAO's **proposal submission threshold**. You can find this number on each protocol's governance page by selecting the "information" section near the top of the page.

### Follow these steps to create a proposal on Tally <a href="#c0cd" id="c0cd"></a>

1. Start a new proposal either from the [Tally Homepage](https://www.tally.xyz/) or your DAO homepage.&#x20;
2. Choose between a poll and on-chain proposal. [What are polls](create-a-proposal.md#what-are-polls)?&#x20;
3. Name your proposal&#x20;
4. Write a detailed description of your proposal using Tally’s Markdown editor and preview mode&#x20;
5. Add a link preview image&#x20;
6. If you selected on-chain proposal: \
   Add up to 10 actions to be executed if the proposal passes. To add an action, use Tally's Transfer Tokens recipe OR add a custom action. To use Tally's transfer tokens recipe, enter the target wallet address, select the token you would like to transfer, and enter the amount of the token you would like to transfer. To add a custom action, enter the target contract address or upload your ABI file if the contract is not on Etherscan, select the desired contract method, and enter the call data for that method.&#x20;
7. Preview your proposal, then save it as a draft OR submit the proposal for voting.&#x20;

### What are Drafts?

* Draft proposals are created off-chain and can later be submitted at any time (even by a different user).&#x20;
* Any member can create a draft - but only those that meet the proposal threshold can submit them
* Drafts are also a great way to get feedback on your proposal before submitting it. &#x20;

### What are Polls?

Polls are similar to Tally's classic On-chain proposals, with a few differences:&#x20;

* Polls are completely free - no gas fees are required to propose or vote
* Polls do not support executable transactions
* Polls are stored off-chain
