# âš– Voting and Delegation

You can participate in governance through the Tally app by delegating your voting power or voting on active proposals directly.&#x20;

To access these features, start by connecting your wallet.

{% content-ref url="connect-your-wallet.md" %}
[connect-your-wallet.md](connect-your-wallet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can then delegate votes or vote on an active proposal through the following steps.

{% content-ref url="delegate-votes.md" %}
[delegate-votes.md](delegate-votes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="vote-on-an-active-proposal.md" %}
[vote-on-an-active-proposal.md](vote-on-an-active-proposal.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Steps to disconnect your wallet or change between addresses are shown here.

{% content-ref url="disconnect-your-wallet.md" %}
[disconnect-your-wallet.md](disconnect-your-wallet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
