# ðŸ—º Navigating the App

The Tally App lets you to review on chain governance information, as well as participate in governance through voting or delegation.&#x20;

When you first visit Tally, the home page will show all currently supported governance systems. Select an option to go to that protocol's **governance page**.

{% content-ref url="governance-page.md" %}
[governance-page.md](governance-page.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The governance page in turn includes links to **proposal pages** for active and past proposals, as well as **voter pages** for delegates and token owners.

{% content-ref url="proposal-page.md" %}
[proposal-page.md](proposal-page.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="voter-page.md" %}
[voter-page.md](voter-page.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Proposal and voter pages are linked by vote participations, which allows you to navigate between them to review delegates' voting behavior.

You can always return to the home page by clicking the Tally logo in the top left corner.
