# Manage Notifications

Start off by logging into your Tally account.

{% content-ref url="log-in.md" %}
[log-in.md](log-in.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Select "notifications" in the top right hand corner.

You're now on the notifications page. If you initially signed up for your account through Twitter, you'll be prompted to provide an email address for notifications.

If you signed up through email, your email address will be pre-filled. Click on the modal button next to each governance system to activate notifications for that protocol.

You will now receive email notifications for the following events in each selected protocol:

* When a proposal is created and the voting period begins
* When a proposal is cancelled
* When the voting period ends and final results are confirmed
* When a passed proposal is executed after the timelock period
