{% hint style="info" %}
If you signed up with Twitter, your handle is already linked to your Tally account and no further action is needed. Follow these steps to link Twitter if you signed up with email and password.

To get started, log in to your Tally account.

{% content-ref url="log-in.md" %}
[log-in.md](log-in.md)
