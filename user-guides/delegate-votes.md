# âš¡ Delegate Votes

## Why is delegation important?

For protocols based on the [Compound governance system](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/compound-governance-design), only delegated tokens can participated in voting. _**What does this mean for you, a token holder?**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
You **must** set up delegation if you want you participate in governance votes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you wish to vote on proposals directly, delegate your voting power to your own address. Or, you can delegate your voting power to another community member and let them to vote on your behalf.

## Delegate to yourself (set up wallet for direct voting):

Click on the button to "delegate to self".

## Delegate votes to another address:

Navigate to the delegate leaderboard at the bottom of the selected governance page. If your preferred delegate is not in the top 10 addresses by voting power, click on the "view all" link to see additional delegates.

Click on the address you'd like to support to view their voter page. Then click on the "delegate vote" button on the right hand side.

Confirm and sign the transaction via your wallet. Your delegation is now complete.

## Confirm your delegation status:

Start by navigating to your address's voter page. If you are among the top 100 addresses by voting power, you can link to your voter page through the "top voters" table at the bottom of the governance page. Alternatively, you can view your address's voter page by pasting the following link into your browser with the relevant details.

So for example, you can view Gauntlet Network's voter page for Compound through the following link:&#x20;

Once you've accessed your voter page, review the "delegating to" section on the right hand side. If you delegated votes to yourself (set up your address for direct voting), you should see "self delegation".

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

If you delegated votes to another address, this section will display a link to that address's voter page.

Note that if you delegated by signature, this update will not be reflected until the receiving delegate address submits your signature as an on chain transaction.
