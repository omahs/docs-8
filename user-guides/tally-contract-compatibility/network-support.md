### Adding chains to Tally

Is there a chain you'd like us to add support for? Add it (or upvote it!) on our [Feature Requests board](https://feedback.tally.xyz/b/feature-requests).&#x20;

To support a chain, Tally has three main dependencies:

* A full node for user web3 calls
* An archive node with a high rate limit for indexing
* A block explorer with an Etherscan-compatible API

There are some more nice-to-have dependencies:

* [Gnosis Safe support](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/contracts/gnosis-safe-on-other-evm-based-networks)
* Support from major wallets
* [Tenderly support](https://docs.tenderly.co/supported-networks-and-languages)
