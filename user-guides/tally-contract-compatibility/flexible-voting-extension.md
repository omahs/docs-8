# Flexible Voting Extension

The Scopelift team built a Flexible Voting extention with support from Uniswap Grants Program. For implementation details, check out [their blog post about flexible voting](https://www.scopelift.co/blog/introducing-flexible-voting):

> This new building block allows arbitrary delegate contracts to be developed which can unlock all kinds of new use cases, such as:
>
> * Voting with tokens while earning yield in DeFi
> * Voting on L2 with bridged tokens
> * Shielded voting (i.e. secret/private voting)
> * Cheaper subsidized signature based voting

Tally would love to add support for this extension, and we're looking for a early integration partners. If you're considering deploying a Governor with flexible voting, reach out to us on Discord, Twitter, or email.
