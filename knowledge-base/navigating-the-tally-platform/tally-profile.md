# ðŸ˜€ Tally Profile

## Your DAOs

> _The Your DAOs page shows all the DAOs you're a member of._

To navigate to the Your DAOs page, simply click your profile name at the top-right corner of Tally and select **Your DAOs**.

You'll see a list of all of the DAOs you're a member of, split into three sections: _Admin_ (DAOs where you have the Superadmin or Admin role), _Governor DAOs_, and _Groups_.

## Profile Page

> _The Profile Page shows on-chain details about an individual address's governance participation and token holdings. It also includes information added to your Tally profile._

At the top, you'll see a voter's display name, wallet address, and linked Twitter account. You'll also see a **Delegate** button, which allows you to [delegate your voting power](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md) to that address.

Below, you'll see that voter's _DAO Memberships_, with information on their voting power and delegations for each DAO.

Finally, the _POAPs_ section displays POAPs held by the address.

## Profile Settings

Once you've [signed in to Tally](getting-started.md), you can access _Settings_ by:

Selecting **Settings** from the drop-down at the top-right corner of Tally...\

...or by clicking **Settings** on your Profile Page.

### Profile Information <a href="#profile" id="profile"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The information you enter in Settings is public to everyone by default. The data on the Profile Page is a mix of on-chain data and off-chain data. Editing your Profile Page adds off-chain data to the on-chain data for your address. In some cases, it overrides the on-chain data (e.g. your Tally name and avatar override your addressâ€™s ENS name and avatar, if any).
{% endhint %}
