# ðŸ—º Navigating the Tally Platform

_Tally is a portal to DAOs like Uniswap, ENS, Gitcoin, NounsDAO and many more._

_Our app helps DAO members start DAOs, delegate their votes, and set up their profile. It also helps manage the proposal lifecycle: creating them, voting on them, and executing them if they pass._
