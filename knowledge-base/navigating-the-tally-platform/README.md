Tally's home page has a ton of useful informationâ€”you can check out our latest blog entries, navigate to resources, and explore DAOs currently using Tally. New to Tally or the DAO space? Here are some good places to start.

1. Click the **Add a DAO** button to add a new or existing DAO to Tally.
2. In the _Explore DAOs_ section, you'll find an overview of DAOs currently on Tally, which you can filter by network or name. Select a DAO to go to its [dao-page.md](dao-page.md "mention").
3. Once you've [connected your wallet](getting-started.md) and signed in to Tally, you'll see your profile at the top right. Click it to access a drop down menu with links to **Your DAOs**, **Profile**, and **Settings**.
