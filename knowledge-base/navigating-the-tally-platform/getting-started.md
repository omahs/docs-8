## Connect Your Wallet

From any page of the Tally site, select the **Connect wallet** button in the top right corner.

In the pop up window, select your preferred wallet service. We support MetaMask and any WalletConnect-supported wallet, desktop or mobile. Hardware wallet users can also connect their device through MetaMask.

Follow the prompts to complete the wallet connection process. You will then see your connected wallet in the top right corner of the site.

## Sign In

> _Tally uses_ [_Sign-In with Ethereum_](https://login.xyz/)_! You'll need to_ [_connect your wallet_](getting-started.md) _before signing in._

Once you've connected your wallet, you'll see a **Sign in** button at the top right corner of the Tally site.

Follow the prompts in the pop up window to sign in using your connected wallet.

The top right section of the page will now show a profile image and dropdown menu, instead of the **Sign in** option.

## Disconnect Your Wallet

> _If you wish to disconnect your wallet from Tally, or switch to an alternate wallet address, you can do this through your selected wallet provider. The steps below show the process for disconnecting a MetaMask wallet._

Open the extension in your browser, then select **Connected** in the upper left.

On the pop up, choose your currently connected wallet and select the option to **Disconnect this account**.&#x20;

You can confirm your wallet has been disconnected by checking the top right corner of Tally, which should now show the option to **Connect wallet**.
