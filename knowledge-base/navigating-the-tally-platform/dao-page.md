At the top of the DAO page, a highlights section shows key information. You'll also see buttons to [**Create new proposal**](../proposals/creating-proposals.md) and [**Delegate vote**](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md). Click the drop-down arrow to view _Contract Parameters._

The next section contains key metrics about your DAO:

* **Proposals:** number of proposals submitted
* **Holders:** total number of addresses holding the governance token
* **Voters:** total number of addresses with voting power delegated to them

The _Voting Power_ chart shows the current top 5 delegates' voting power over time, and _Top Voters_ ranks those delegates by voting power.

The _Proposals_ section shows a list of proposals associated with the DAO. Any active proposals will be shown at the top, with a chronological list of past proposals below. Click **View all** to see more.

The _Governor Assets_ or _Timelock Assets_ section (if the DAO has a Timelock) displays information on the DAO's top assets. Click **View all** for an extended list.

Below, the _Gnosis Safes_ section displays information on any [linked Gnosis Safes](../managing-a-dao/gnosis-safe.md).

Finally, the bottom of the DAO page shows the [DAO Admins](../managing-a-dao/dao-admins.md)â€”users who are able to update settings on the Tally DAO Page.
