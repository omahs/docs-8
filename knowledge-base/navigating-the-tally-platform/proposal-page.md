# ðŸ’­ Proposal Page

_The Proposal Page shows details of a particular active or past proposal. You can navigate back from a Proposal Page to the linked_ [_DAO Page_](dao-page.md) _by clicking its name at the top left._

The top of the page shows the proposal title, its current status, the block when the voting period ends, and the estimated end time. It also shows the addresses that submitted and created the proposal. The **Vote** button is only available while a proposal is still active.

The _Voting_ chart below the proposal title shows participating addresses, with bubble sizes proportional to voting power. The _Votes_ table to the right lists participating addresses, while the _Status history_ section shows the proposal's current and past statuses. Below, you'll also see the _Participation rate_ and _Voting timeline_ chart, which shows voter participation over time.

The _Votes_ table only shows addresses voting **For** a proposal by default. Select the **Against** or **Abstain** button to see those opposing the proposal or abstaining from voting, or the **View all** button at the bottom to open a page with all addresses in a single ranked list.

The _Details_ section at the bottom of the Proposal Page shows the proposal's _Description_. If you used a recipe to create the proposal, you'll see an infographic there. There's also a **Media attachment** button to view any media associated with the proposal.&#x20;

Select the **Executable code** button to review the proposal's on-chain effects. One of the advantages of on-chain DAOs is that anyone can see the exact smart contract calls that a proposal will make if it passes.

_All addresses shown on the proposal page are clickable links that direct you to that address's associated_ [_Profile Page_](tally-profile.md)_!_
