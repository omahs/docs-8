# Profile Page

> _The Profile Page shows on-chain details about an individual address's governance participation and token holdings. It also includes information added to your Tally profile via_ [profile-settings.md](profile-settings.md "mention")_._

At the top, you'll see a voter's display name, linked Twitter account, and personal description, which can all be updated from [profile-settings.md](profile-settings.md "mention"). Below, the numbers of delegations, proposals voted on, proposals created, and DAOs a user is a member of are listed. You'll also see a **Delegate** button, which allows you to [delegate-your-voting-power.md](../proposals/delegate-your-voting-power.md "mention") to that address.

If an address participates or holds tokens in multiple supported protocols, you can switch between the relevant governance systems with the buttons in the _Your DAOs_ section.&#x20;

Selecting a DAO will display key details about that user's _Activity_ in the governance. It will also filter _Recent votes_ and _Created proposals_ by that specific DAO.

In the _Created proposals_ section, when no DAO button is selected, you can view all proposals created by the address.

_Each item in the Recent votes and Created proposals sections is a clickable link, directing you to the relevant_ [proposal-page.md](proposal-page.md "mention")_!_
{% endhint %}

Finally, the _POAPs_ section displays POAPs held by the address.
