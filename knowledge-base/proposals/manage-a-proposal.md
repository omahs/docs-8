* [_Canceling Proposals_](https://help.tally.xyz/article/58-canceling-proposals)

**Queuing, executing, and canceling proposals can all be accomplished directly from the** [**Proposal Page**](https://help.tally.xyz/article/23-proposal-page)**.**

### Queuing and Executing Proposals

Once a proposal passes, you can queue and execute it from the same place you voted:
