# ✅ Voting on Proposals

_In order to vote on a proposal, first make sure that you've_ [_connected your wallet_](https://help.tally.xyz/article/7-connect-your-wallet) _and_ [_delegated voting power to yourself_](https://help.tally.xyz/article/27-delegate-votes#yourself)_!_

_Note that tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. **You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**_

In the _Voting_ pop up, choose your vote— **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**. ( _Note that Abstain isn't an option in all DAOs, depending on their contract setup._) If you'd like, **add a comment** to explain the reason for your vote to the rest of your DAO. Once you're done, click **Submit**.

### Confirm Your Vote Status <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

Navigate to your [Profile Page](https://help.tally.xyz/article/24-profile-page) by clicking your profile name at the top right and selecting  **Profile** from the drop-down.

The _Recent votes_ section displays your voting participation in proposals across all of your DAOs. You can also **select a DAO button** under _Your DAOs_ to filter votes by a specific DAO.

_Having trouble voting? There are a few common culprits to rule out..._

#### Are your votes delegated?

For DAOs that use the [Governor contract](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/what-is-a-governor-contract), only delegated tokens can participate in voting. If you want to vote on proposals directly, you need to delegate your voting power to your own address. Check out our [Delegate Your Voting Power](https://help.tally.xyz/article/27-delegate-votes) doc for a step-by-step guide!

#### Is the vote for an off-chain poll?

For [off-chain polls](https://help.tally.xyz/article/53-create-a-poll) created in a Governor DAO, we use a snapshot to determine token weighted voting power. If you receive tokens _after_ the proposal was created, you won't be able to vote.

#### Have you waited for Tally to index the on-chain event?

Tally may still be indexing the vote—check back in a bit!

It's easy to [confirm your vote status](https://help.tally.xyz/article/26-vote-on-an-active-proposal#confirm) on Tally! Still not seeing what you'd expect? Give us a shout at **help@tally.xyz**.
