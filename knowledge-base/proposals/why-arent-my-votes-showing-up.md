# Why Aren't My Votes Showing Up?

_Having trouble voting? There are a few common culprits to rule out..._

#### Are your votes delegated?

For DAOs that use the [Governor contract](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/what-is-a-governor-contract), only delegated tokens can participate in voting. If you want to vote on proposals directly, you need to delegate your voting power to your own address. Check out our [Delegate Your Voting Power](https://help.tally.xyz/article/27-delegate-votes) doc for a step-by-step guide!

#### Is the vote for an off-chain poll?

For [off-chain polls](https://help.tally.xyz/article/53-create-a-poll) created in a Governor DAO, we use a snapshot to determine token weighted voting power. If you receive tokens _after_ the proposal was created, you won't be able to vote.

#### Have you waited for Tally to index the on-chain event?

Tally may still be indexing the voteâ€”check back in a bit!
