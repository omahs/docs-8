description: How to get delegation during Delegation Week

# Free Delegation

As part of Delegation Week, Tally is enabling free delegation! To make it easier for token holders to participate, DAOs can now sponsor the gas for delegation transactions. With free delegation, token holders do not need any ETH at all in their accounts to delegate.

#### Why free delegation?

Gas costs are a significant barrier to governance participation. Token holders will be more likely to delegate and re-delegate their tokens during Delegation Week if they don’t have to pay gas to do so.

#### How does free delegation work?

Several DAOs – Arbitrum, Uniswap, ENS, Gitcoin and PoolTogether – have set up free delegation on Tally during Delegation Week. Eligible token holders can come to Tally and delegate their voting power to themselves or someone else. Tally will relay the signed EIP-2771 transaction and cover the gas.

To prevent spam, we’ll put in place some restrictions:&#x20;

1. Tally will only relay transactions for token holders who held the governance token prior to Delegation Week, on May 1, 2023
2. Tally will only relay for token holders who hold at least a minimum number governance tokens. The minimums vary per DAO: 10 ENS, 10 UNI, 30 GTC, 40 ARB, or 50 POOL
3. Tally will only relay a delegation transaction once per wallet per DAO&#x20;

Token holders who aren’t eligible can still delegate normally by paying their own gas.&#x20;

#### How can my DAO enable free delegation?

If you want Tally to set up transaction relaying for your DAO, you will need to decide on a budget and prepay Tally in ETH or USDC. If your budget is not consumed during Delegation Week, we will return the remainder.
