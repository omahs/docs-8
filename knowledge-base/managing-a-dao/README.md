# ⚒ Managing a DAO on Tally

_Adding a Governor DAO to Tally is easier than ever! You can get started in a few quick steps, even if you haven't yet_ [_deployed your Governor contract_](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/deploying-governor-daos)_._

Select the  **Add a DAO** button on the Tally home page.

In the pop-up modal, enter the name of your DAO, add a description, and select **Next**.

Select **Governor (advanced)** as your voting style and select **Submit**. This enables _on-chain voting_, but requires gas fees for transactions and a deployed Governor contract. If you haven't deployed your contract just yet, no worries—you can still get started and add it

Enter the address of your deployed Governor contract (if you have one), then select **Set Governor Contract**. If you still need to deploy your contract and just want to get started on Tally with your DAO info, select **Skip**!

You'll be taken to your _DAO Settings Page_, where you can link your [Governor contract](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/what-is-a-governor-contract) and Gnosis Safe, manage DAO admins, and update DAO info. The _Getting started_ checklist at the top will help you onboard your DAO to the Tally ecoystem!
