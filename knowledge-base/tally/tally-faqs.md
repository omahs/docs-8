# ❓ Tally FAQs

## How is Tally different than Snapshot?

The big difference between Tally and off-chain voting tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) and others is that Tally supports fully on-chain DAOs.

**On-chain DAOs use smart contracts to propose, vote on and execute proposals. That makes DAO operations automated, trustless, and more decentralized.**

The Governor smart contract is responsible for managing proposals, counting votes and executing passed proposals on-chain with no human intervention. The benefit of a Governor DAO is that the token holders or NFT membership holders have direct control over the protocol and/or treasury through voting. Holders don’t have to trust their multi-sig signers to execute a proposal vote, and they don’t have to worry about rogue multi-sig signers creating a transaction that wasn’t approved by the voters. The tradeoff is that creating on-chain proposals and voting isn't free: it costs gas.

For more information about deploying or upgrading to an on-chain DAO, see [deploying-daos](../../user-guides/deploying-daos/ "mention").
